# ML-optimized-microstrip-patch-antenna
This project optimizes the performance of a flag-shaped microstrip patch antenna using ML models like SVM, Random Forest, and their GA-based hybrids. The dataset is generated through HFSS simulations, focusing on improving impedance matching and return loss using AI-driven design techniques.
